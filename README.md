# Ground_Sample_Distance_Calculator
Calculates the pixel spatial resolution and image footprint from common drone cameras at different heights above ground.

This script calculates the pixel spatial resolution (in cm) and the resulting image footprint width (in meters) and height (in meters) 
for a  drone camera capturing a vertical image.
